# ComfyUI Base Image

This directory contains the base image for ComfyUI recipes. It builds on the ai-dock comfy base image and adds the [ComfyUI API](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api) server.

Starting with comfy version 0.2.6, it also includes the [ComfyUI CLI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli) for easy node management.
