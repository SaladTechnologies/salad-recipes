* Configure the Dockerfile file near the end to include your desired model, either via a link in the MODEL_ID section (as in the example), or linking to a .CPKT file instead
* CD into your working directory
* Run `docker build -t dockerName .`
* Once built, run `docker run --gpus=all -p 50150:50150 dockerName`
* Send POST request to http://localhost:50150 to test, using below example POST request:
  ```json
  {
  "modelInputs": {
    "prompt": "YOUR PROMPT GOES HERE!",
    "negative_prompt": "YOUR NEGATIVE PROMPT GOES HERE!",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
    "guidance_scale": 7.5,
    "width": 512,
    "height": 512,
    "seed": 3239022079,

  },
  "callInputs": {
    "PIPELINE": "StableDiffusionPipeline",
    "SCHEDULER": "LMSDiscreteScheduler",
    "safety_checker": "true"
    }
  }
* Send identical POST request to your designated URL endpoint

# Releasing your Docker image
* Once you have a working test Docker built, either push directly to your Docker Repository, or rebuild it with desired tagging and name, and then push your Docker Container to your Docker Repository
* Create your Salad Portal container group, and use your docker image source
* Connect Salad Networking to port 50150

    see the [guide](https://forums.kiri.art/t/run-diffusers-api-on-runpod-io/102)

1. **Building from source**.

    1. Fork / clone this repo.
    1. `docker build -t gadicc/diffusers-api .`
    1. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more helpful hints.

*Other configurations are possible but these are the most common cases*

Everything is set via docker build-args or environment variables.

## Usage:

See also [Testing](#testing) below.

The container expects an `HTTP POST` request to `/`, with a JSON body resembling the following:

```json
{
  "modelInputs": {
    "prompt": "Super dog",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
    "guidance_scale": 7.5,
    "width": 512,
    "height": 512,
    "seed": 3239022079
  },
  "callInputs": {
    // You can leave these out to use the default
    "MODEL_ID": "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
    "PIPELINE": "StableDiffusionPipeline",
    "SCHEDULER": "LMSDiscreteScheduler",
    "safety_checker": true,
  },
}
```

It's important to remember that `docker-diffusers-api` is primarily a wrapper
around HuggingFace's
[diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library.
**Basic familiarity with `diffusers` is indespensible for a good experience
with `docker-diffusers-api`.**  Explaining some of the options above:

* **modelInputs** - for the most part - are passed directly to the selected
diffusers pipeline unchanged.  So, for the default `StableDiffusionPipeline`,
you can see all options in the relevant pipeline docs for its
[`__call__`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img#diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline.__call__) method.  The main exceptions are:

    * Only valid JSON values can be given (strings, numbers, etc)
    * **seed**, a number, is transformed into a `generator`.
    * **images** are converted to / from base64 encoded strings.

* **callInputs** affect which model, pipeline, scheduler and other lower
level options are used to construct the final pipeline.  Notably:

    * **`SCHEDULER`**: any scheduler included in diffusers should work out
    the box, provided it can loaded with its default config and without
    requiring any other explicit arguments at init time.  In any event,
    the following schedulers are the most common and most well tested:
    `DPMSolverMultistepScheduler` (fast!  only needs 20 steps!),
    `LMSDiscreteScheduler`, `DDIMScheduler`, `PNDMScheduler`,
    `EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler`, `EulerDiscreteScheduler`.

    * **`PIPELINE`**: the most common are
    [`StableDiffusionPipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img),
    [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/img2img),
    [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/inpaint), and the community
    [`lpw_stable_diffusion`](https://forums.kiri.art/t/lpw-stable-diffusion-pipeline-longer-prompts-prompt-weights/82)
    which allows for long prompts (more than 77 tokens) and prompt weights
    (things like `((big eyes))`, `(red hair:1.2)`, etc), and accepts a
    `custom_pipeline_method` callInput with values `text2img` ("text", not "txt"),
    `img2img` and `inpaint`.  See these links for all the possible `modelInputs`'s
    that can be passed to the pipeline's `__call__` method.

    * **`MODEL_URL`** (optional) can be used to retrieve the model from
    locations other than HuggingFace, e.g. an `HTTP` server, S3-compatible
    storage, etc.  For more info, see the
    [storage docs](https://github.com/kiri-art/docker-diffusers-api/blob/dev/docs/storage.md)
    and
    [this post](https://forums.kiri.art/t/safetensors-our-own-optimization-faster-model-init/98)
    for info on how to use and store optimized models from your own cloud.

## Examples and testing

There are also very basic examples in [test.py](./test.py), which you can view
and call `python test.py` if the container is already running on port 8000.
You can also specify a specific test, change some options, and run against a
deployed banana image:

```bash
$ python test.py
Usage: python3 test.py [--banana] [--xmfe=1/0] [--scheduler=SomeScheduler] [all / test1] [test2] [etc]

# Run against http://localhost:8000/ (Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000)
$ python test.py txt2img
Running test: txt2img
Request took 5.9s (init: 3.2s, inference: 5.9s)
Saved /home/dragon/www/banana/banana-sd-base/tests/output/txt2img.png

# Run against deployed banana image (Nvidia A100)
$ export BANANA_API_KEY=XXX
$ BANANA_MODEL_KEY=XXX python3 test.py --banana txt2img
Running test: txt2img
Request took 19.4s (init: 2.5s, inference: 3.5s)
Saved /home/dragon/www/banana/banana-sd-base/tests/output/txt2img.png

# Note that 2nd runs are much faster (ignore init, that isn't run again)
Request took 3.0s (init: 2.4s, inference: 2.1s)
```

The best example of course is https://kiri.art/ and it's
[source code](https://github.com/kiri-art/stable-diffusion-react-nextjs-mui-pwa).

## Help on [Official Forums](https://forums.kiri.art/c/docker-diffusers-api/16).

## Adding other Models

You have two options.

1. For a diffusers model, simply set `MODEL_ID` build-var / call-arg to the name
  of the model hosted on HuggingFace, and it will be downloaded automatically at
  build time.

1. For a non-diffusers model, simply set the `CHECKPOINT_URL` build-var / call-arg
  to the URL of a `.ckpt` file, which will be downloaded and converted to the diffusers
  format automatically at build time.  `CHECKPOINT_CONFIG_URL` can also be set.

## Troubleshooting

* **403 Client Error: Forbidden for url**

  Make sure you've accepted the license on the model card of the HuggingFace model
  specified in `MODEL_ID`, and that you correctly passed `HF_AUTH_TOKEN` to the
  container.

## Event logs / web hooks / performance data

Set `SEND_URL` (and optionally `SIGN_KEY`) environment variable(s) to send
event and timing data on `init`, `inference` and other start and end events.
This can either be used to log performance data, or for webhooks on event
start / finish.

The timing data is now returned in the response payload too, like this:
`{ $timings: { init: timeInMs, inference: timeInMs } }`, with any other
events (such a `training`, `upload`, etc).

You can go to https://webhook.site/ and use the provided "unique URL"
as your `SEND_URL` to see how it works, if you don't have your own
REST endpoint (yet).

If `SIGN_KEY` is used, you can verify the signature like this (TypeScript):

```ts
import crypto from "crypto";

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const data = req.body;

  const containerSig = data.sig as string;
  delete data.sig;

  const ourSig = crypto
    .createHash("md5")
    .update(JSON.stringify(data) + process.env.SIGN_KEY)
    .digest("hex");

  const signatureIsValid = containerSig === ourSig;
}
```

If you send a callInput called `startRequestId`, it will get sent
back as part of the send payload in most cases.

You can also set callInputs `SEND_URL` and `SIGN_KEY` to
set or override these values on a per-request basis.
