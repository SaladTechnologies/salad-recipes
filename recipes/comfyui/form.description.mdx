Run popular image generation models with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/) and [ComfyUI API](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api). Model weights are included in the container.

<Callout variation="warning">Ensure your use is permissible under whatever license applies to the model you are using.</Callout>

This recipe **DOES NOT** expose the ComfyUI web interface, it only provides the API interface via the [ComfyUI API](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api).

The ComfyUI API server is designed to be stateless, meaning that it does not store any state between requests. This allows the server to be scaled horizontally behind a load balancer, and to handle more requests by adding more instances of the server. The server uses a warmup workflow to ensure that ComfyUI is ready to accept requests, and to pre-load any required models. The server also self-hosts swagger docs and an openapi spec at `/docs`, which can be used to interact with the API.

## Request Format

Prompts are submitted to the server via the `POST /prompt` endpoint, which accepts a JSON body containing the prompt graph, as well as any additional parameters such as the webhook URL, S3 bucket and prefix, and image conversion options. A request may look something like:


<Callout variation="warning">This is not a complete request body, as it does not include a node that saves an output.</Callout>

```json
{
  "prompt": {
    "1": {
      "inputs": {
        "image": "https://salad-benchmark-assets.download/coco2017/train2017/000000000009.jpg",
        "upload": "image"
      },
      "class_type": "LoadImage"
    }
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "convert_output": {
    "format": "jpeg",
    "options": {
      "quality": 80,
      "progressive": true
    }
  }
}
```

- Only the `prompt` field is required. The other fields are optional, and can be omitted if not needed.
- Your prompt must be a valid ComfyUI prompt graph, which is a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is an object containing the node's inputs, class type, and optional metadata.
- Your prompt must include a node that saves an output, such as a `SaveImage` node.

## Image To Image Workflows

The ComfyUI API server supports image-to-image workflows, allowing you to submit an image and receive a modified version of that image in response. This is useful for tasks such as image inpainting, style transfer, and other image manipulation tasks.

To use image-to-image workflows, you can submit an image as a base64-encoded string, http(s) URL, or S3 URL. The server will automatically detect the input type and process the image accordingly. If you are using S3, you must customize the deployment to add your AWS credentials to the environment variables.

Here's an example of doing this in a `LoadImage` node:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "image": "https://salad-benchmark-assets.download/coco2017/train2017/000000000009.jpg",
    "upload": "image"
  },
  "class_type": "LoadImage",
  "_meta": {
    "title": "Load Image"
  }
}
```
