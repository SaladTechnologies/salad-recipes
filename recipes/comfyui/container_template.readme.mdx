## Request Format

Prompts are submitted to the server via the `POST /prompt` endpoint, which accepts a JSON body containing the prompt graph, as well as any additional optional parameters such as the webhook URL and image conversion options. A request may look something like:

<Callout variation="warning">This is not a complete request body, as it does not include a node that saves an output.</Callout>

<CodeBlock language="json">{`{
  "prompt": {
    "1": {
      "inputs": {
        "image": "https://salad-benchmark-assets.download/coco2017/train2017/000000000009.jpg",
        "upload": "image"
      },
      "class_type": "LoadImage"
    }
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "convert_output": {
    "format": "jpeg",
    "options": {
      "quality": 80,
      "progressive": true
    }
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

- Only the `prompt` field is required. The other fields are optional, and can be omitted if not needed.
- Your `prompt` must be a valid API-formatted ComfyUI prompt graph, which is a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is an object containing the node's inputs, class type, and optional metadata.
- Your prompt must include a node that saves an output, such as a `SaveImage` node.

### Curl Example

<Callout variation="note">Requires `curl` and `jq` to be installed.</Callout>

Save your request body to a file called `prompt.json` and run the following command:

<Callout variation="note">If you do not have auth enabled, you can omit the `Salad-Api-Key` header.</Callout>

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`curl -X POST https://${props.networking.dns}/prompt \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Salad-Api-Key: ${props.apiKey}" \\
  -d @prompt.json | jq -r .images[0] | base64 --decode > output.jpg
`}</CodeBlock>

The generated image will be saved as `output.jpg` after decoding the base64 response.

## Image To Image Workflows

The ComfyUI API server supports image-to-image workflows, allowing you to submit an image and receive a modified version of that image in response. This is useful for tasks such as image inpainting, style transfer, and other image manipulation tasks.

To use image-to-image workflows, you can submit an image as a base64-encoded string, http(s) URL, or S3 URL. The server will automatically detect the input type and process the image accordingly. If you are using S3, you must customize the deployment to add your AWS credentials to the environment variables.

Here's an example of doing this in a `LoadImage` node:

<CodeBlock language="json">{`{
  "inputs": {
    "image": "https://salad-benchmark-assets.download/coco2017/train2017/000000000009.jpg",
    "upload": "image"
  },
  "class_type": "LoadImage",
  "_meta": {
    "title": "Load Image"
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>
