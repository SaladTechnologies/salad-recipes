SaladCloud will find a qualified node, and begin the process of downloading the container image to the host machine. It may take up to tens of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network conditions of that particular node. Remember, these are privately owned PCs with gaming GPUs in a variety of networking conditions, and performance will vary across different nodes.

Eventually, you will see your instance enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the "Ready" column. 

At this time the container group will be considered running and you will see new instances under Worker Details in the Kuzco Inference dashboard.
