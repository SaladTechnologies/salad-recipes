Run a [Kuzco](https://devnet.inference.net/) worker node on Salad using this recipe.

Kuzco is a distributed GPU cluster built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate inference of large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA 3, Mistral, and Phi-3. By running a Kuzco worker, you earn $INT points for compute time.

<Callout variation="warning">
You must register a Kuzco worker and provide a valid worker_code to use this recipe. Without it, the worker will fail to register with the Kuzco controller.
</Callout>

This container launches a single Kuzco **worker**, which connects to the Kuzco controller, pulls the specified model, and serves inference traffic.
