By running a Kuzco worker, you earn $INT points for compute time.\n\n<Callout variation=\"warning\">\nYou must register a Kuzco worker and provide a valid CODE to use this recipe. Without it, the worker will fail to register with the Kuzco controller.\n</Callout>\n\nThis container launches a single Kuzco **worker**, which connects to the Kuzco controller, pulls the specified model, and serves inference traffic.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Register an account at [devnet.inference.net/register](https://devnet.inference.net/register)\n2. Verify your email address\n3. Go to the **Workers** tab in your dashboard\n4. Click **Create Worker** (top-right)\n5. Choose a name, select **Docker**, and click **Create Worker**\n6. On the Worker Details page, click **Launch Worker**\n7. Copy the generated **Worker Code** and paste it into the <code>worker_code</code> field in this recipe\n\nFor full setup instructions, see the [Kuzco Guide](https://docs.devnet.inference.net/advanced/docker)\n",
