Deploy Meta's Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) for zero-shot image segmentation with a REST API interface.

SAM3 is Meta's latest foundation model for image segmentation, capable of segmenting any object in an image using:

- **Point prompts**: Click on objects to segment them
- **Box prompts**: Draw bounding boxes around objects
- **Text prompts**: Describe objects in natural language (open-vocabulary)

## Prerequisites

**HuggingFace Access Required**: SAM3 model weights require approval from Meta. Before deploying:

1. Visit the [SAM3 model page on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3)
2. Request access to the model weights
3. Once approved, create a HuggingFace access token
4. Enter your token in the form below

## API Endpoints

This recipe provides a FastAPI-based REST API with the following endpoints:

- `POST /segment_file` - Upload an image file for segmentation
- `POST /segment_url` - Segment an image from a URL
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /docs` - Swagger API documentation

## Output Formats

- **JSON** (default): Returns RLE-encoded masks with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- **Annotated**: Returns the image with colored mask overlays
