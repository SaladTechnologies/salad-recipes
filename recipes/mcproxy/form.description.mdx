Deploy remote headless browser sessions via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI agents on SaladCloud.

MCProxy enables AI agents to control browsers running on geographically distributed containers. Use cases include regional price checking, geo-targeted content verification, and distributed web automation.

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chromium (default)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

**Mobile Device Emulation:**
Emulate 100+ mobile devices with accurate viewport, user agent, and touch support:
- iPhone (15, 14, 13, SE, etc.)
- iPad (Pro, Air, Mini)
- Pixel (7, 6, 5, etc.)
- Galaxy (S23, S22, Tab, etc.)

**Key Features:**
- **Stealth Mode**: WebGL spoofing, navigator overrides, and realistic browser fingerprints
- **Humanized Interactions**: Human-like clicks, typing, and scrolling to avoid bot detection
- **Cloudflare Auto-Wait**: Automatically wait for challenges to complete
- **Cookie Persistence**: Save and restore cookies for session management
- **Location-Aware**: Sessions report geographic location (city, country, timezone)
- **33 MCP Tools**: Full browser automation including coordinate-based clicking for vision agents
