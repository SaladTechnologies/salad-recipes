## Configuration

- **Container Group Name** (required) - Unique identifier for your deployment
- **Algorithm** (required) - Mining algorithm (defaults to AUTOLYKOS2 for Ergo)
- **Pool URL** (required) - Pool address with protocol (e.g., `stratum+tcp://ergo.2miners.com:8888`)
- **Wallet Address** (required) - Your wallet address for the coin being mined
- **Worker Name** (optional) - Custom worker name (defaults to unique ID)
- **Extra Arguments** (optional) - Additional lolMiner command-line arguments

## Example Pool URLs

| Coin | Pool | URL |
|------|------|-----|
| Ergo | 2miners | `stratum+tcp://ergo.2miners.com:8888` |
| Ergo | Herominers | `stratum+tcp://ergo.herominers.com:10250` |
| ETC | 2miners | `stratum+tcp://etc.2miners.com:1010` |
| Ravencoin | 2miners | `stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060` |
| Kaspa | acc-pool | `stratum+tcp://kas.acc-pool.pw:16061` |
| Flux | 2miners | `stratum+tcp://flux.2miners.com:9090` |

## Mining Payouts

Mining rewards are paid directly to your wallet by the mining pool:

1. Your miner submits shares to the pool as proof of work
2. When the pool finds a block, rewards are distributed based on shares contributed
3. Each pool has a minimum payout threshold (e.g., 0.5 ERG on 2miners)
4. Once your balance reaches the threshold, the pool automatically sends coins to your wallet

Check your mining progress and balance on the pool's dashboard by searching for your wallet address.
