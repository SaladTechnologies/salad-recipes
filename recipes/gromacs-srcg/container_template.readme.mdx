## Access

- Click on a running instance to access a browser-based terminal.

Keep in mind that SaladCloud instances are ephemeral and can be reallocated at any time, resetting to a fresh image. Make sure to persist any important data to a remote location, such as S3 or a database, to avoid losing it when the instance is reset.
