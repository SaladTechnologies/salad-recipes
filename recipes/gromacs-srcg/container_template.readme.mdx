# GROMACS

## Access
- <Link url={`https://${props.networking.dns}/lab`}>JupyterLab</Link> (once running)
- You can also click on a running instance in the Portal to access a browser-based terminal.

Files can be easily uploaded and downloaded through the JupyterLab interface. Keep in mind that SaladCloud instances are ephemeral and can be reallocated at any time, resetting to a fresh image. For production workloads, consider integrating your image with cloud storage to ensure data persistence.
