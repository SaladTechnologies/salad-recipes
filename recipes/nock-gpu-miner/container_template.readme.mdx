# Nockpool GPU Prover

This miner links directly to your [NockPool account](https://nockpool.com/) via the `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` you supply in the recipe form.

## Setup checklist

- Sign up/sign in at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) and connect your wallet so a payout address is set.
- Generate your account token on the [NockPool Setup page](https://nockpool.com/setup) and keep it private. Rotate it if you believe it is compromised.
- Paste the token into this recipe; it is injected into the container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`. If you need to change it, click "Edit" above and update `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Have another miner? Review the [SaladCloud custom miner guide](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/how-to-guides/miners/run-miners-on-saladcloud) to deploy any other miners.

## Payout notes

- Nockpool charges a 4% pool fee on all blocks won by the pool. Network transaction fees are included only on withdrawals.
- Set your payout address, mine to earn NOCK, and request [payout](https://nockpool.com/payouts) once you have at least **50.00 NOCK**; keep **20.00 NOCK** available for network fees.
- Payouts are processed once daily, using payout requests submitted by **12AM GMT**.

## About NOCK token
NOCK is the native token of the Nockchain network. Nockchain is a novel Layer-1 blockchain focused on "programmable sound money," uniquely using Zero-Knowledge Proof of Work (zkPoW) for consensus, not just traditional hashing, allowing for verifiable, efficient, and scalable computation within its network. By running the NockPool Prover on SaladCloud, you contribute compute power to the network and earn NOCK tokens based on the computational work your nodes submit.

## Priority Level
Default priority level is set to "lowest" to reduce cost. If you experience frequent interruptions, consider increasing priority by editing container group configuration. Learn more about priority levels in [SaladCloud documentation](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/explanation/billing-pricing/priority-pricing).
