    "readme": "# NockPool GPU Miner\n\nThis miner links directly to your [NockPool account](https://nockpool.com/) via the `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` you supply in the recipe form.\n\n## Setup checklist\n\n- Sign up/sign in at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) and connect your wallet so a payout address is set.\n- Generate your account token on the [NockPool Setup page](https://nockpool.com/setup) and keep it private. Rotate it if you believe it is compromised.\n- Paste the token into this recipe; it is injected into the container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.\n- Have another miner? Review the [SaladCloud custom miner guide](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/how-to-guides/miners/run-miners-on-saladcloud) to deploy any other miners.\n\n## Payout notes\n\n- Note that NockPool charges a fee on all payouts.\n- Set your payout address, mine to earn NOCK, and request payout once you have at least **50.00 NOCK**; keep **20.00 NOCK** available for network fees.\n- Payouts are processed once daily, using payout requests submitted by **12AM GMT**.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [NockPool Setup](https://nockpool.com/setup)\n- [Recipe Source](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-recipes/tree/master/recipes/nock-gpu-miner)\n\n## Priority Level\nDefault priority level is set to \"lowest\" to reduce cost. If you experience frequent interruptions, consider increasing priority by editing container group configuration. Learn more about priority levels in [SaladCloud documentation](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/explanation/billing-pricing/priority-pricing).\n",
