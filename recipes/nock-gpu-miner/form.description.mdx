Mine NOCK using NockPool GPU Prover. You'll provide a NockPool account token that links your miner to your wallet.

1. Sign up or sign in at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) and follow the [setup guide](https://nockpool.com/setup).
2. Connect your wallet in NockPool so your payout address is set.
3. Generate and copy your account token (starts with `nockacct_`) from the NockPool Setup page, then paste it into this form.
4. Keep the token private; it will be injected into your container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.

### Payout reminders

- Nockpool charges a 4% pool fee on all blocks won by the pool. Network transaction fees are included only on withdrawals.
- Set your payout address, mine to earn NOCK, complete KYC, and request payout once you have at least 50.00 NOCK (minimum 20.00 NOCK left for network fees).
- Payouts are processed once daily based on requests submitted by 12AM GMT.

### Priority Level
Default priority level is set to "lowest" to reduce cost. If you experience frequent interruptions, consider increasing priority by editing container group configuration. Learn more about priority levels in [SaladCloud documentation](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/explanation/billing-pricing/priority-pricing).

### About NOCK token
NOCK is the native token of the Nockchain network. Nockchain is a novel Layer-1 blockchain focused on "programmable sound money," uniquely using Zero-Knowledge Proof of Work (zkPoW) for consensus, not just traditional hashing, allowing for verifiable, efficient, and scalable computation within its network. By running the NockPool Prover on SaladCloud, you contribute compute power to the network and earn NOCK tokens based on the computational work your nodes submit.
