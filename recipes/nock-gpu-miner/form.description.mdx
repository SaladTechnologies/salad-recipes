Mine NOCK using NockPool GPU miner. You'll provide a NockPool account token that links your miner to your wallet.

1. Sign up or sign in at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) and follow the [setup guide](https://nockpool.com/setup).
2. Connect your wallet in NockPool so your payout address is set.
3. Generate and copy your account token (starts with `nockacct_`) from the NockPool Setup page, then paste it into this form.
4. Keep the token private; it will be injected into your container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.

### Payout reminders

- Note that NockPool charges a fee on all payouts.
- Set your payout address, mine to earn NOCK, complete KYC, and request payout once you have at least 50.00 NOCK (minimum 20.00 NOCK left for network fees).
- Payouts are processed once daily based on requests submitted by 12AM GMT.
