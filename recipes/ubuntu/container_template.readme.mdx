## Access

- <Link url={`https://${props.networking.dns}/lab`}>JupyterLab</Link> (once running)
- <Link url={`https://vscode.dev/tunnel/${props.id}/workspace`}>VS Code</Link>, if configured.
- Click on a running instance to access a browser-based terminal.

Keep in mind that SaladCloud instances are ephemeral and can be reallocated at any time, resetting to a fresh Ubuntu image. Make sure to persist any important data to a remote location, such as S3 or a database, to avoid losing it when the instance is reset.
