Run fast and accurate object detection with YOLO, a computer vision model for detecting objects in images and video.

This Salad recipe provides a REST API interface for inference via FastAPI. It includes support for:

- Image files
- Video files
- Remote URLs (images, videos, YouTube)
- Annotated (visual) or raw JSON detection results
- Object Tracking
- YOLO parameter customization
- Swagger API Docs. Available after deployment

## ðŸ“¤ Request Format

The app exposes two endpoints:

- `POST /process_file`: Accepts file uploads via `multipart/form-data`
- `POST /process_url`: Accepts paths to remote images, videos or YouTube URL

Both support:

- `annotated`: `true` to return annotated visuals with boxes and confidence scores
- `track`: Enables object tracking (video only)
- Any additional YOLO inference settings (e.g., `conf`, `iou`, `imgsz` etc.)

## ðŸ§  Supported Models

You can use any YOLO base model or your own fine-tuned model by setting the `Model Name` environment variable:

- Any base detection models: `yolov11n.pt`, `yolov8s.pt`...
- Custom `.pt` models
