[A GROMACS image integrated with Salad Kelpie](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-kelpie/no_sync_image/Dockerfile) runs on RTX 4090 (24GB).

Please familiarize yourself with [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) and [GROMACS with Job Queue](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/how-to-guides/molecular-dynamics-simulation/gromacs-job-queue) on SaladCloud before running the recipe.

You’ll need to provide the Container Group Name and access to S3-compatible storage when launching the recipe. The hardware configuration—including vCPU, memory, and GPU—can be adjusted as needed.

Once the container group is running, its instances retrieve jobs from Salad Kelpie, download the required files from the storage, run simulations, and upload the state and results.

Ensure that all job input files are uploaded to the storage before submitting the jobs. See [this link](https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/how-to-guides/molecular-dynamics-simulation/gromacs-job-queue#submitting-jobs) for more details.
