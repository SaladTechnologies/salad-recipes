Serve Unsloth-optimized large language models behind a managed FastAPI gateway. 
This recipe deploys a lightweight Uvicorn service that loads the selected Unsloth model on GPU and exposes `/health` and `/v1/generate` endpoints.

Use the fields below to set the container group name, toggle SaladCloud gateway authentication, and override the default model configuration (model id, dtype, max sequence length, and token cap).

You can update these values later from the container group page if you need to switch models or adjust limits.
