# OpenMM

## Access
- <Link url={`https://${props.networking.dns}`}>OpenMM Playground</Link> (once running)
- You can also click on a running instance in the Portal to access a browser-based terminal.

Use OpenMM Setup to run simulations interactively. Files can be easily uploaded and downloaded through the JupyterLab interface. 

Keep in mind that SaladCloud instances are ephemeral and can be reallocated at any time, resetting to a fresh image. For production workloads, consider integrating your image with cloud storage to ensure data persistence.
