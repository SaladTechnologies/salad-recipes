The VS Code Server CLI is also pre-installed, allowing you to connect to the instance with VS Code for debugging. \n\nYou’ll need to provide the Container Group Name and set the Replica Count to 1 when launching the recipe. The hardware configuration—including vCPU, memory, and GPU—can be adjusted as needed. The Container Gateway is mandatory and cannot be disabled.\n\nThis will create a OpenMM playground environment with example files available in the /app/examples folder. \n\nPlease note that you’ll need to shut down the instance manually in the Portal when you’re finished.\n",
