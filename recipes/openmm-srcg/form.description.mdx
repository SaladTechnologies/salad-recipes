[A basic OpenMM image](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/openmm-srcg/Dockerfile.recipe) run on a RTX 4090 (24GB) to get started with molecular dynamics simulations on SaladCloud.
 
Please familiarize yourself with [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) and the [OpenMM solution on SaladCloud](https://docs.salad.com/guides/molecular-dynamics-simulation/openmm-srcg) before running the recipe.

[OpenMM Setup](https://github.com/openmm/openmm-setup) is provided to run simulations interactively.

Includes JupyterLab for easy terminal access. The VS Code Server CLI is also pre-installed, allowing you to connect to the instance with VS Code for debugging. 

You’ll need to provide the Container Group Name and set the Replica Count to 1 when launching the recipe. The hardware configuration—including vCPU, memory, and GPU—can be adjusted as needed. The Container Gateway is mandatory and cannot be disabled.

This will create a OpenMM playground environment with example files available in the /app/examples folder. 

Please note that you’ll need to shut down the instance manually in the Portal when you’re finished.
