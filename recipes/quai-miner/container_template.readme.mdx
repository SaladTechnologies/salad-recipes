# Quai Miner

SaladCloud will find qualified nodes, and begin the process of downloading the container image to the host machine. It may take up to tens of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network conditions of that particular node. Remember, these are privately owned PCs with gaming GPUs in a variety of networking conditions, and performance will vary across different nodes.

Eventually, you will see your instances enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the "Ready" column. You are only charged for instances that are in the running state.

Each container instance will have the machine ID as the worker tag.
